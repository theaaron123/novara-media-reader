The rising anger at exploding inequality, indebtedness and general misery in the country found a political expression in Bernie Sanders\u2019s two presidential campaigns.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those campaigns produced the rise of an American socialist movement for the first time in half a century through the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), along with likeminded groups like the Sunrise Movement, a principal force advocating for a Green New Deal, and the progressive electoral group Justice Democrats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, he was the only self-identified socialist in congress \u2014 with few to be found in state and local offices. Now, DSA members like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib have been elected to the House of Representatives, while around <a href=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/2020\/08\/04\/beyond-bernie-down-ballot-races-to-watch-in-august-and-september\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">100 socialists have won office further down the ticket<\/a>: six socialists on the Chicago city council, Julia Salazar and Jabari Brisport in the New York state senate, Lee Carter in the Virginia state legislature, along with many others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, DSA has worked in coalition with a wide range of organisations on numerous campaigns for labour unions, affordable housing, climate change, immigrant rights and every other major issue in American politics today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as heartening as that rebirth is, nobody should get carried away. The left has come a long way since 2016, but it\u2019s a long way from almost nothing. As <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jacobinmag.com\/2020\/08\/bernie-sanders-five-year-war\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">historian Matt Karp <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">puts it<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: \u201cThe left, after Bernie, has finally grown just strong enough to know how weak it really is.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter which candidate wins in next month\u2019s presidential election, this reborn left won\u2019t disappear. But the outcome will determine the terrain they will fight on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Yesterday\u2019s man, today.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, the race\u2019s most likely outcome is a Joe Biden victory. Any electoral prognosticator winces at articulating this, given that Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory was also considered the most likely outcome in 2016 \u2014 and we all know how that turned out. However, with Americans having watched Trump in action for the last four years, capped off with Covid-19 denialism which resulted in his catching it just weeks before the election, all signs point to majorities<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/2020\/10\/08\/trump-thinks-he-can-use-his-coronavirus-diagnosis-to-his-advantage-he-cant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not liking what they\u2019ve seen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a Biden presidency would put the left on far more favourable terrain than under Trump, this isn\u2019t because Biden has any left sympathies. On the contrary, he has been a key figure in nearly every step of the party\u2019s rightward turn over the last half-century, from the Iraq war to the mass incarceration regime to even breaking with the party\u2019s mainstream to flip-flop on abortion rights. In his book <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.versobooks.com\/books\/3225-yesterday-s-man\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yesterday\u2019s Man: The Case Against Joe Biden<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Branko Marcetic even goes as far as to say: \u201c[T]he brand of liberal politics that he and much of the Democratic Party had pursued for decades created the ideal set of circumstances for [Trump] to come to power.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, organising under a Biden presidency would be more favourable to the left for two principal reasons: one, there is little expectation that he will deliver a robust left-wing agenda once in the White House and every expectation sustained popular mobilisations to demand he meet our urgent demands \u2014 fights that will only be led by the left \u2014 will be required. And two, Biden\u2019s election would pump the brakes on the violent, anti-democratic right that has grown increasingly rabid and<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2020\/08\/kyle-rittenhouse-qanon-donald-trump-the-right\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unmoored from reality<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at Trump\u2019s urging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For millions of Americans, a Trump defeat would constitute a shot in the arm and ray of political hope in what has been an otherwise relentlessly bleak year. And unlike with Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008, there now exists a significant left in the US with no illusions about Biden&#8217;s &#8220;progressive&#8221; credentials. They take him at his word<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/joe-biden-wont-demonize-the-rich_n_5d09ac63e4b0f7b74428e4c6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when he <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says that<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d in America under his presidency; they rightly see Biden as a billionaire-backed enemy to transforming American politics and will treat him as such.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even liberal voters suspicious of or uninterested in the newly rising American socialism voted for Biden in the primary mostly for the simple reason that he wasn\u2019t Trump. That\u2019s why, instead of a long honeymoon phase of political deference to the liberal establishment, we can expect mass mobilisations demand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Biden immediately reverse Trump&#8217;s reactionary policies, bail out workers and public services, implement a Green New Deal and pass labour law reform to make it easier to build unions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, Biden will do everything possible to defend the status quo by lowering people\u2019s political expectations. In the name of a return to \u201cnormalcy,\u201d the Democratic establishment will likely push hard for \u201cnational unity\u201d and consensus around the status quo before Trump.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s one reason why Biden is already <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/22\/us\/politics\/bidens-response-to-voters-concerned-about-socialism-i-beat-the-socialist.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">going out of his way to emphasise<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> how much he disagrees with Bernie Sanders, as well as constantly emphasising that he will not pursue <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/biden-debate-liberals\/2020\/09\/30\/88c54b90-033b-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medicare for All<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/energy-and-environment\/21498236\/joe-biden-green-new-deal-debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green New Deal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

When Democrats are in power, it is far easier to demonstrate the gap between their rhetoric and their actions. Instead of four more years dominated by an overriding progressive desire to boot Trump from office \u2014 an understandable desire, which turned out to be a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/karpmj\/status\/1315798512731291648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">major obstacle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to Bernie\u2019s chances in the 2020 primary \u2014 the left can make clear that removing the Republicans from office is far from enough to bring about the change working people need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, for all his many faults, Biden represents a reprieve from the openly anti-democratic, violent strains of right-wing politics on which Trump has staked his entire presidency. Biden will likely govern as a cautious neoliberal, but at least he won\u2019t be openly declaring his intentions to ignore electoral results, amplifying white supremacists from Twitter or a presidential debate stage or praising shooters who gun down anti-racist protesters on the streets. A national politics rooted more in reality than the demented contours of Trump\u2019s deeply damaged brain will also prove far better terrain for the left to operate on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there\u2019s also a danger here. Given the enormous spike in far-right activity and conspiracising under, and encouraged by Trump, as well as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blubrry.com\/jacobin\/68155345\/vast-majority-log-off-in-your-heart-with-matt-christman\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a growing society-wide conversation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the role of social media in stoking violence and far-right extremism, we can assume that as president, Biden will pursue efforts to curtail this activity, especially online. With that said, considering his constant willingness to outflank the right in the face of conservative pushback on any issue, a Biden-led crackdown on far-right activity could also boomerang back on the left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve already seen this happen. Late this summer,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2020\/08\/20\/facebook-bans-antifascist-pages\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook shut down<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a wide range of far-right pages affiliated with conspiracy theories like QAnon and militia groups.

Given this history, we might expect Biden to pursue a kind of hollow \u201cboth sides\u201d approach to shutting down both fascists and anti-fascists, and the left should be prepared to resist it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, despite the clear limitations, a Biden presidency beats the alternative for the new socialist movement. His victory is the outcome leftists should hope for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Drifting further away from reality.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One saving grace for the left under Trump\u2019s presidential term has been the simple fact that the gap between his reactionary rhetoric and his ability to concentrate long enough to turn that rhetoric into policy is vast.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump is the first American president with the attention span of a goldfish.

But he\u2019s been largely unable or uninterested in pulling off anything ambitious like a 21st-century red scare or launching a new war.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What he <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> done though is pull the country further and further away from basic democratic norms and reality itself, moving the terrain of politics into the libidinal pleasures of an all-encompassing, neverending culture war \u2014 one in which right-wing violence against liberals and the left is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2020\/09\/kyle-rittenhouse-trump-own-the-libs-kill-the-libs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">praised and encouraged<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The list of Trump\u2019s assaults on democracy is long.

He has sown doubt about voting by mail in order to justify stealing the election, saying last month, \u201cWe have to be very careful with the ballots. The ballots \u2014 you know, that\u2019s a whole big scam.\u201d He has even encouraged his supporters to intimidate voters at the polls, which<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/19\/us\/politics\/trump-supporters-early-voting-virginia.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some have then done<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and tweeted encouragingly about California Republicans who are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">openly and brazenly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/10\/14\/politics\/california-republicans-ballot-drop-boxes-cease-and-desist\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stealing mail-in ballots<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Political violence has steadily been on the rise in the US under Trump. The examples are too numerous to list out: the killing of antiracist protester Heather Heyer by a right-wing extremist at an antiracist counter-protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017; the recent alleged murder of two protesters by 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the police shooting of a Black man named Jacob Blake. And for every slaying in America, there are dozens of incidents of nonlethal political violence in the streets, nearly all of which have been carried out by the right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump has egged this violence on. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/19\/us\/politics\/trump-qanon-conspiracy-theories.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">publicly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/10\/16\/opinions\/trump-qanon-dodge-ghitis\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">repeatedly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> defended the bizarre and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2020\/oct\/15\/qanon-violence-crimes-timeline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">violent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> QAnon conspiracy theorists.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of Rittenhouse, he actually<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/politics\/2020\/08\/31\/trump-defends-kenosha-shooter-kyle-rittenhouse-arguing-self-defense\/3451006001\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">publicly supported<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> him. He has consistently refused to condemn white-supremacist violence despite numerous opportunities to do so, including his now-infamous command for white supremacist group the Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d at the recent presidential debate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThese groups don\u2019t need a big signal to get emboldened to commit violence,\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/2020\/10\/will-far-right-violence-erupt-on-election-day.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said Katherine Belew<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a historian of organised white-supremacist groups, shortly after the debate. \u201c[T]his was a loud, loud statement.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this is horrific in its own right.

Trump\u2019s re-election would be a demoralising blow to anybody interested in progressive change. Biden, for all his many shortcomings, will at least provide a terrain in which people believe that popular mobilisations might have a chance at winning real change. In this presidential election, that\u2019s the best that can be hoped for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the principal task for the left will be the one that\u2019s already underway: continuing to run down-ballot socialists, embedding socialists in the labour movement and becoming shop-floor union leaders, fighting for essential policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, and building a movement that can win the kind of substantive leftist politics that neither party has on offer.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"single-articles-copy\" class=\"text-copy margin-top-basic margin-bottom-basic\">\n<p><em>Micah Uetricht is the deputy editor of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/jacobinmag.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacobin\u00a0magazine<\/a>\u00a0and host of its podcast\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/jacobin-radio\/id791564318\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Vast Majority<\/a>.

It is also alleged that Juan Carlos received a $100m donation from the king of Saudi Arabia, of which he is thought to have <a href=\"https:\/\/english.elpais.com\/spanish_news\/2020-07-06\/recipient-of-65m-from-spains-emeritus-king-claimed-money-was-a-gift-and-not-a-bid-to-hide-the-funds.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gifted two-thirds to his former lover<\/a>, Corinna Larsen, after the money was stashed away in an offshore account.<\/p>\n<p>Long protected by the comprehensive crown immunity laws enshrined in the Spanish constitution, Juan Carlos finds himself no longer covered by the <a href=\"https:\/\/thediplomatinspain.com\/en\/2014\/06\/inviolability-political-immunity-emeritus-king\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impunity he once enjoyed<\/a>. Despite his abscondment, he has said he remains \u201cat the disposal\u201d of the courts.<\/p>\n<p>But the disclosures of the last six months have not only rocked the Spanish monarchy; they have also shaken the foundations of &#8211; and raised new questions for &#8211; the post-1978 political and constitutional settlement Juan Carlos sat atop for almost 40 years.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the significance of the scandals for the Spanish monarchy?<\/h3>\n<p>The 82-year-old is widely considered to have been the architect, or father figure, of the post-transition consensus referred to by some Spaniards as the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2015\/04\/podemos-spain-pablo-iglesias-european-left\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regime of \u201878<\/a>\u2019. As General Franco\u2019s named successor, Juan Carlos is remembered for turning away from the dictator\u2019s absolute rule by setting in motion a series of reforms that would lead the country to its current democratic and constitutional framework.<\/p>\n<p>For many years, the renewed constitutional process which began in the late seventies was held up as an exemplary model for democratic transitions &#8211; with hardly a shot fired, even despite the upheavals of the transition years, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/1981\/feb\/23\/spain.fromthearchive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">failed military coup<\/a> in 1981 (another key episode in Juan Carlos\u2019 and modern Spain\u2019s foundational myth).<\/p>\n<p>But the revelations over Juan Carlos\u2019s unlawful profiteering not only tarnish the reputation of a figurehead who, until recent years, could muster broad support from a range of diverse sectors across Spanish society &#8211; they underline something crucial about the character of the country\u2019s young democracy and the nature of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2018\/12\/spain-transition-franco-gonzalez-constitution-podemos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the transition<\/a> that produced it.<\/p>\n<p>The alternative reading of the period highlights the monarchy\u2019s role in the safeguarding of elite interests and privileges &#8211; many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2020\/06\/francisco-franco-spain-monuments-fascism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquired during the dictatorship<\/a> &#8211; as Spain began to open up economically and enter a new democratic period. It also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2020\/08\/monarchism-spain-king-corruption\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">traces similar financial gifts<\/a> from Middle Eastern moguls all the way back to the late 1970s, when Juan Carlos began to operate as a key conduit between foreign oligarchs and Spanish capital.<\/p>\n<p>This counternarrative holds that the culture of cronyism and corruption &#8211; now visibly embodied by Juan Carlos and much of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2019\/nov\/19\/socialist-ex-presidents-of-andalucia-guilty-in-680m-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">political class<\/a> that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/news\/2019\/mar\/01\/spain-watergate-corruption-scandal-politics-gurtel-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">presided over the consensus<\/a> he ushered in &#8211; is, in large part, a reflection of the political compromises made during these years. Failure to capitalise on popular anti-Franco sentiment and organised labour mobilisations amid the upheavals of the late seventies meant Spain\u2019s emerging democracy was defined by top-down reforms and protection of an elite-interests racket.<\/p>\n<p>Juan Carlos\u2019s 2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2014\/jun\/02\/spains-king-juan-carlos-to-abdicate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">abdication<\/a> &#8211; prompted by an elephant-hunting trip in Botswana at the height of the post-crash austerity years &#8211; was intended to put a stop to the sorts of headlines afflicting the royal house of late, and to restabilise the regime around current king, Felipe. But the immediate fallout from this year\u2019s sleaze saga has already forced Felipe to renounce his father\u2019s inheritance, and has pushed the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to publicly voice his unease and propose a (limited) reform of crown immunity.<\/p>\n<h3>What has the reaction been?<\/h3>\n<p>When the initial revelations broke, during the height of lockdown, there were noisy, sustained <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-health-coronavirus-spain-king\/spaniards-in-lockdown-bang-pots-in-protest-during-kings-speech-idUKKBN21526R\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demonstrations from thousands of Spanish balconies<\/a>, as protesters demanded the former king donate his murky Saudi millions to Spain\u2019s struggling public health service.<\/p>\n<p>As those protests began to die away, however, it became increasingly clear how muted the civil society response to the developing crisis for the monarchy was. Although the lack of a reply is partially explained by the restrictions and unique circumstances brought on by the pandemic, it also signals weaknesses within the Republican movement in Spain, which is diffuse and lacks <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-spain-royals\/protesters-call-for-end-to-spanish-monarchy-after-former-kings-exit-idUKKCN2550FQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the ability to reach beyond<\/a> region-specific independence campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, much in the same way Juan Carlos\u2019s stage-managed exit was secretly coordinated and facilitated by the country\u2019s establishment powers, any spontaneous response within Spain has been limited by years of careful curation of public opinion on questions of the monarchy. Famously, the state pollster CIS does not conduct surveys on levels of popular support for the institution, while a broad party-political bloc pledges unbudging loyalty to the king emeritus &#8211; blocking the possibility of any mooted referendum that would raise the prospect of a new republic.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it appears the Spanish right is attempting to seize the initiative generated by the wider unease and discontent over the last six months &#8211; although, so far, with limited purchase &#8211; on the back of a largely self-inflicted crisis within the regime. The radicalised opposition is attempting to capitalise on the political fallout of the pandemic with a view to pushing the political dial towards a scenario whereby a \u2018national [emergency]\u2019 administration, as a means of removing leftwing Unidas Podemos from office, is convincingly presented as unavoidable.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the implications for Spain\u2019s left government?<\/h3>\n<p>The latest crisis of the monarchy has heightened pre-existing divisions and tensions within the <a href=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/2020\/01\/26\/now-unidas-podemos-must-show-it-can-deliver\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eurozone\u2019s only leftwing coalition government<\/a>. One of the primary sore points has been that junior coalition partner Unidas Podemos was kept uninformed of Juan Carlos\u2019 planned self-exile, while senior coalition partner PSOE &#8211; wedded to the monarchy and the broader post-\u201978 consensus &#8211; has attentively helped manage and facilitate his flight behind the scenes.<\/p>\n<p>Led by Pablo Iglesias, Unidas Podemos is unwilling to break up the coalition over the issue, due in part to parliamentary arithmetic, instead choosing to reserve ammunition for a series of key battles ahead (the 2021 budget and the ambition of overturning neoliberal labour reforms chief among them). First, however, the coalition government, which took office just three months before the pandemic hit Europe, faces a series of renewed challenges to its survival.<\/p>\n<p>Although widely considered a stunt, the no-confidence motion far-right party Vox is preparing for September seems likely to set the tone for a schizophrenic autumn cycle &#8211; a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 comprising the economic fallout of the pandemic; a slow-burning <a href=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/2019\/11\/05\/spains-coming-election-will-determine-the-next-phase-of-its-constitutional-crisis\/\">constitutional crisis<\/a>; the incendiary <a href=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/2019\/02\/12\/catalonia-as-independence-leaders-stand-trial-is-spain-edging-towards-constitutional-crisis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Catalan question<\/a> potentially re-entering the frame, with regional elections on horizon; a radicalised Spanish right that has never accepted the coalition\u2019s legitimacy and, mirroring elements of the Venezuelan opposition, now is attempting to bring down the government by fuelling a climate of chaos.<\/p>\n<p>This makes the <a href=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/2020\/01\/26\/now-unidas-podemos-must-show-it-can-deliver\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">task of this government<\/a> all the more urgent. Over the next six to nine months, it needs to secure a series of clear legislative gains over the budget, historical memory legislation and reform of Spain\u2019s notorious gag laws, among other areas. As wider developments look to envelope the fledgling administration, the stakes have arguably never been higher.<\/p>\n<p><em>Tommy Greene is a freelance journalist and translator based in Spain.<\/em><\/p>\n",

However, the AYMs played a vital role in the fight waged against systemic racism.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Asian activists who organised during the 1970s and 80s, were, through their anti-racist politics and Black self-identification, part of the wider Black Power movement, which saw Afro-Caribbean and South Asian migrants build strong networks of solidarity in the face of British racism.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The history of the movement not only demonstrates the power of community mobilisation and direct action, but also shows the advantages of political Blackness, a principle that has since been replaced by the ethnic nationalism we see today.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23753\" src=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/asian-protestors.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"874\" height=\"574\" srcset=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/asian-protestors.jpg 480w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/asian-protestors-150x98.jpg 150w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/asian-protestors-204x134.jpg 204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>The start of a movement.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The spark that ignited the AYMs came in the form of 18-year-old Gurdip Singh Chaggar\u2019s murder in 1976, and the subsequent disregard shown by Southall police. Chaggar\u2019s stabbing by a group of racist white youths, while out with a friend, was the catalyst for Asian youths who had grown up against a backdrop of police racism, National Front agitations and anti-immigrant sentiment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to Chaggar\u2019s death, Southall\u2019s Asian community came together to voice their frustration at the years of racism and violence they had faced. On 6 June, a meeting was held at the local Dominion cinema to discuss how the community could move forward. Frustrated by the lack of radical anti-racist action, a group of young Asians, mainly men in their late teens and twenties, marched to the local police station and demanded protection for their community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galvanised by the spontaneous action, the group of young radicals organised themselves into a community defence force, thereby formalising the Southall Youth Movement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_23748\" style=\"width: 884px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-23748\" class=\"wp-image-23748\" src=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"874\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement-.jpg 800w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--150x84.jpg 150w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--460x259.jpg 460w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--204x114.jpg 204w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--314x176.jpg 314w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--424x238.jpg 424w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--664x373.jpg 664w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--974x548.jpg 974w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/southyall-youth-movement--1304x733.jpg 1304w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-23748\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Southall Youth Movement protest about the death of Blair Peach, who was killed during a protest.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike their parents\u2019 generation, the Asian youths of the 1970s had grown up with a deeper sense of their British identity, and with it, the systemic and interpersonal racism that goes hand in hand with living in a predominantly white imperialist country. As <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/OGWX233kHPg?t=150\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hari Sandhu<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a founding member of the Southall Youth Movement, recalls, racist Teddy boys would \u201c[pick] on the Asian community\u201d, physically attacking them to steal their wages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such attacks were an expression of the overarching atmosphere of racial hostility brought on by the economic recession of the mid-1970s, which saw migrant communities scapegoated by politicians, the press and disgruntled working-class Britons, who struggled to find work or access welfare.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most powerful example of this <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">antagonism<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came in the form of disgraced Conservative MP Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous 1968 &#8216;rivers of blood&#8217; speech, which specifically targeted South Asians in condemning non-white immigration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the face of such a brutal racial climate, various Asian political groups began emerging across the country. In 1977, a year after the Southall Youth Movement was founded, the Indian Progressive Youth Association was formed in Bradford. However, in response to criticism over the narrowness of an exclusively Indian group, the association was reformed as the Bradford AYM.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspired by what was happening in Bradford, sister movements emerged in cities like London, Leicester, Sheffield, Nottingham, Birmingham and Luton &#8211; all areas with a sizeable South Asian population, or severe racial tensions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_23750\" style=\"width: 884px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-23750\" class=\"wp-image-23750\" src=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Liberation-the-newsletter-of-the-Manchester-AYM..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"874\" height=\"728\" srcset=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Liberation-the-newsletter-of-the-Manchester-AYM..jpg 700w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Liberation-the-newsletter-of-the-Manchester-AYM.-150x125.jpg 150w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Liberation-the-newsletter-of-the-Manchester-AYM.-204x170.jpg 204w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Liberation-the-newsletter-of-the-Manchester-AYM.-664x553.jpg 664w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Liberation-the-newsletter-of-the-Manchester-AYM.-448x373.jpg 448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-23750\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Liberation, the newsletter of the Manchester AYM.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In identifying as Asian, these groups were able to create a far stronger, more unified anti-racist community defence. The broad encapsulating term saw these young activists championing secularism and unity, opening their organisations to all in the South Asian community, irrespective of cultural, religious or political divisions which existed on the subcontinent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Embracing political Blackness.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further redefining their identity, significantly, the AYMs conceived of themselves as Black &#8211; in a political rather than ethnic sense. Employed as an umbrella term for non-white communities to use in organising against white supremacy, political Blackness was ubiquitous among anti-racist groups during the 1970s and 80s, and explains why the AYMs included members from the Afro-Caribbean community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focussing on the deep commonalities of structural oppression facing working-class black and brown communities, this racial unification was essential in fighting the evils of institutional and interpersonal racism. When attacking non-white communities, British racists saw no distinction between them &#8211; these activists recognised the benefit of such homogeny and used it to their advantage.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of political Blackness were demonstrated during various anti-racist campaigns, such as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/2020\/07\/10\/black-britannia-the-race-today-collective-demonstrated-the-radical-potential-of-journalism\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bengali housing struggle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in east London and the strike against Imperial Typewriters in Leicester. On both occasions, Black and Asian people united in opposition to racial discrimination. Asian activists Mala Sen and Farrukh Dhondy played a significant role in the mobilisation of such campaigns, whilst also serving in organisations such as the Black Panther Movement and Race Today Collective.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Fighting for justice.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the AYMs took up an array of causes, they consistently protested immigration controls, which they<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> believed were used to limit the rights of Asian and Black people residing in Britain. While such legislation impacted all migrant communities, the Asian community was particularly targeted as various laws had been created in response to waves of South Asian migration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AYMs adopted a campaigning strategy which focussed on highlighting institutional racism while also using individual immigration cases to humanise the struggle and offer the public a point of entry into a complex discourse. Allied organisations such as the Campaign Against Racist Laws joined forces with the AYMs to picket and petition against the state\u2019s immigration laws. The case of Anwar Ditta was a watershed moment, garnering widespread support and media coverage and demonstrating the effectiveness of the movement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">British-born Ditta moved to Pakistan as a minor and married Shuja ud Din, with whom she had three children. After moving to Britain in 1975, the Home Office denied the couple\u2019s application to bring their children to the country, citing irregularities in their documents and suggesting that Ditta bore no relation to her children.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response, the Manchester and Bradford AYMs joined forces with various workers\u2019 associations, MPs from across the political spectrum, and even influential white allies like actress Vanessa Redgrave, to form the Anwar Ditta Defence Campaign.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having exhausted all legal avenues, the AYMs organised various demonstrations, at which Ditta was encouraged to speak about the emotional weight of her case. This action prompted popular current affairs programme World in Action to make a documentary on Ditta\u2019s case in 1981. The documentary resulted in blood tests being sought from Ditta\u2019s children, which proved their relation and led to the overturning of the Home Office\u2019s decision.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_23744\" style=\"width: 884px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-23744\" class=\"wp-image-23744\" src=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-17.04.43.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"874\" height=\"696\" srcset=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-17.04.43.png 442w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-17.04.43-150x119.png 150w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-07-24-at-17.04.43-204x162.png 204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-23744\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ditta\u00a0addressing a picket at Blackpool beach during the Labour Party conference there in 1980.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undeniably, such successes would not have been possible without the determined efforts of the AYMs. The strategy of self-reliance and direct action resulted in greater victories, as the support of traditional leftwing organisations, such as trade unions and the Labour party, proved wavering. As Birmingham AYM member Bhupinder Bassi reflected: \u201cThe only way for Black people to fight was through a process of dignity and self-reliance [with] our own communities&#8230;ultimately our white comrades would leave.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Corrupted by the state.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the early years of the AYMs, the organisations relied primarily on resources and funds that they acquired themselves and most remained independent of state institutions, squatting their offices and running through donations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the AYMs and the popularity of political Blackness declined with the introduction of state funding, which weakened the group\u2019s cross-ethnic coalition and commitment to grassroots, self-determining organisation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1981 Scarman report, commissioned in the aftermath of the Brixton riots, stressed the need for greater state funding of \u201cethnically disadvantaged\u201d communities. In response, the state, through local councils, began funnelling money to many anti-racist organisations such as the Youth Movements, thus changing the groups&#8217; dynamic and nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advent of state funding, as historian <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.plutobooks.com\/9781849649469\/black-star\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anandi Ramamurthy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> argues, \u201cimpacted on the principles of self-reliance\u201d. The AYMs made frequent applications for funding and many times their requests were met, enabling them to hire full-time workers and reduced the need for crowdfunding. However, it also curtailed their freedom to organise, dampening momentum and the sense of accountability &#8211; previously, the groups were run by member donations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Tariq Mehmood, the first appointed employee of the Bradford AYM, recalls, the introduction of state funding ushered in corruption and divisions within the organisation:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne day I was thinking about how things changed. I felt that the AYMs initially was a people&#8217;s organisation and once we received funding we were answerable to an institution; the very same institution that we were fighting &#8211; the British state. A people&#8217;s organisation should only be responsible to the people, not to the funders&#8230; And I took a very strong exception as time went on believing that we shouldn&#8217;t apply for the money.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Council funding was effective in destroying the broad-based coalitions that had been previously formed on the principle of political Blackness. Where they had previously worked together, finite state resources resulted in Afro-Caribbean and South Asian communities becoming competitive, highlighting their differences and distinctions in a bid to secure resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-23755\" src=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group-685x864.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"874\" height=\"1103\" srcset=\"https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group-685x864.jpg 685w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group-119x150.jpg 119w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group-204x257.jpg 204w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group-664x838.jpg 664w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group-296x373.jpg 296w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group-581x733.jpg 581w, https:\/\/novaramedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Monitoring-Group.jpg 761w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" \/><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the growing movement towards ethnic nationalism, some sections of the Asian community, such as the South Asia Solidarity Group (SASG) remained critical of the new development. In an early pamphlet, published in 1989 and entitled Asian Culture: Black Resistance, the SASG attacked British multiculturalism, writing: \u201cThis culture is now being defined by the state in a form which is entirely static and unconnected with Black people\u2019s everyday struggles in Britain.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing their critique, SASG launched an attack on state funding, arguing that it was producing a \u201cnew [salaried] stratum of black community leaders\u201d who were aiding, rather than fighting, the state in creating \u201cnarrow ethnic nationalist approaches\u201d to anti-racism.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the omnipresence of racism and the gradual disintegration of their broad-based alliances, the AYMs, which had once been so radical and militant, waned in influence. The groups began to splinter as some members moved away from their previous radical stances, such as Bradford West MP Marsha Singh, and retreated to traditionally leftist corners such as the Labour party, while others became consumed in state initiatives for diversity and inclusion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global, as well as domestic, factors contributed to the demise of the AYMs, changing the dynamics within the Asian community in Britain. The shifting geopolitical climate, which saw Islam increasingly vilified by Western media and politicians, resulted in the increasing marginalisation of the Muslim community. In the face of ostracism by not only white society but also sections of the Asian community, Muslims in Britain founded separate political organisations to address the specific needs of their religious community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Learning from a legacy.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This demonisation of South Asians in Britain continues today: from the implementation of Prevent, the government\u2019s programme to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tackle violent extremism, which is built on a foundation of Islamophobia,\u00a0to the racially charged debates over the burka. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the face of this ongoing and ubiquitous racism, the AYMs offer inspiration for the potential of successful grassroots resistance across religious, cultural, political and national lines, while also providing an important warning about the dangers of state intervention and over-reliance on state funds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the rejection of political Blackness in contemporary political discourse, the AYMs make a strong case for embracing anti-racist solidarity in offering an effective challenge to white supremacy, rather than getting lost in a futile cycle of endless infighting and fragmentation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only by moving away from today\u2019s needlessly divisive racial identity politics, to embrace a more inclusive, solidaristic way of organising, will the current movement be able to offer a meaningful challenge to the insidious racism of the British state.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bryan Knight is an oral historian and journalist based in London.

      "rendered": "<p><em>The government has promised it will \u2018build back better\u2019, using the opening created by Covid-19 to decarbonise the UK economy and create new jobs in green sectors. The parallels with Labour\u2019s \u2018green industrial revolution\u2019 are clear \u2013 both proposals aim to simultaneously increase investment, create jobs and ensure we hit our decarbonisation targets.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Along with the money already allocated in the budget, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is using this \u2018mini\u2019 fiscal event to pledge \u00a33bn worth of green investment. \u00a32bn will come in the form of vouchers provided to households for the purpose of increasing the energy efficiency of their homes. Sunak has also announced support for employers who keep furloughed workers on until January \u2013 a tapering of the furlough scheme rather than an abrupt end.<\/p>\n<p>But the chancellor\u2019s promises fall far short of the funding required to tackle climate breakdown. In comparison, Germany is promising <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-01-14\/germany-goes-greener-with-95-billion-push-for-train-over-plane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00a386bn worth of green investment<\/a> to create jobs and decarbonise its rail system and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/jul\/07\/treasurys-green-recovery-not-enough-say-campaigners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00a336bn for a green economic recovery package<\/a>. Here in the UK, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/jul\/07\/treasurys-green-recovery-not-enough-say-campaigners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ed Matthew from the environmental think tank E3G<\/a> has put the cost of making all homes energy efficient at \u00a318bn, substantially more than the \u00a32bn offered by the chancellor.<\/p>\n<p>The spending commitments in this mini-budget do have to be put into context. Projections from the Office for Budgetary Responsibility suggest that the government deficit this year <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2020\/may\/14\/uk-budget-deficit-to-rise-to-300bn-this-year-obr-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">could reach \u00a3300bn<\/a> \u2013 the highest peacetime on record. In this context, one might think the chancellor\u2019s extra spending looks quite generous.<\/p>\n<p>But these are not ordinary times. The Bank of England has said GDP could <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2020\/may\/07\/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contract by 25% in the second quarter of the year<\/a>. When the furlough scheme ends, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2020\/jun\/16\/uk-jobcentre-claimants-coronavirus-crisis-unemployment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unemployment could reach 3m<\/a>. Elsewhere, similar falls in output are being recorded for nearly all the UK\u2019s major trading partners. We are facing what could be the most significant economic contraction in living memory \u2013 and in that context, the government\u2019s spending promises look very mild indeed.<\/p>\n<p>As well as comparing the promises on offer to the scale of the economic devastation we are experiencing, we also need to compare them to the threat we face from climate breakdown. If emissions continue to rise along current trends, we could soon be facing a near uninhabitable \u2018hothouse earth\u2019 in which many of the ecological systems required to sustain human life break down beyond repair.<\/p>\n<p>Of particular concern are the fast approaching \u2018tipping points\u2019 that could accelerate the pace of climate breakdown. The earth is filled with naturally-occurring carbon \u2018sinks\u2019 &#8211; like forests, oceans and tundra. When these sinks become saturated, they lose their ability to absorb more CO2, dramatically increasing the amount that is released into the atmosphere. These tipping points represent the points of no return for climate breakdown.<\/p>\n<p>It should now be clear that the planet cannot avoid climate change altogether. Already, the increase in global temperatures we\u2019ve seen over the past several decades has disrupted the climate, leading to many more natural disasters than we otherwise might have faced. From cyclones in Mozambique and Bangladesh to wildfires in Australia and California \u2013 climate breakdown is very much already with us.<\/p>\n<p>The sums that would be required to stop us reaching ecological tipping points are huge \u2013 trillions of dollars distributed over the world\u2019s largest states. Boris Johnson recently compared himself to US president Franklin D. Roosevelt, who in the 1930s introduced the New Deal. Some estimates suggest that the New Deal was worth around 30% of GDP at its peak. Sunak\u2019s mini-budget spending pledges, meanwhile, don\u2019t even scratch 1% GDP.<\/p>\n<p>The chancellor will probably get away with concealing the meanness of his climate pledges from voters. Few people really understand the scale of funding required to decarbonise the UK economy and the results of failing to do so won\u2019t be felt in full for several decades.<\/p>\n<p>But it will be far harder to disguise the weakness of the UK\u2019s economic response to the pandemic. When the furlough scheme ends, unemployment will rise substantially. If unemployment reaches the worst possible projections, many households will be unable to pay their debts, rents and bills \u2013 leading to an increase in insolvencies. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/8a551c37-2de8-446b-a8b8-d4a61d33ef73\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Banks have estimated that 40-50% of the small businesses<\/a> making use of the government\u2019s \u2018bounce back loan\u2019 scheme will default when the funding ends. The impact of a significant increase in corporate and personal defaults on our financial system could be enormous.<\/p>\n<p>Even if we manage to avoid a financial crisis \u2013 which would require the government to extend business loan guarantees and provide significant income support to struggling households \u2013 the recovery from the recession is likely to be long and slow, just like the non-existent recovery from the financial crisis. Productivity and wages have both stagnated for a decade, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/1ea8527a-5464-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8m households were already struggling with problem debt<\/a> before the pandemic hit.<\/p>\n<p>Unless the government invests in creating millions of new, secure, well-paid green jobs, the \u2018recovery\u2019 from the pandemic will be even weaker \u2013 if it even comes at all.<\/p>\n<p><em>Grace Blakeley is an economics commentator and the author of <a href=\"https:\/\/repeaterbooks.com\/product\/stolen-how-to-save-the-world-from-financialisation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stolen: How to save the world from financialisation<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n",

The past few weeks, however, have undoubtedly been the worst of her career, with the airline proposing reforms that will radically impact her working conditions, making her poorer and less secure.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re being treated appallingly,\u201d she explains, \u201cand will be worse off in every way if BA gets their way\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Covid-19 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/travel\/news-and-advice\/coronavirus-cost-airline-industry-flights-loss-a9376871.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decimating the airline industry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, BA has proposed mass lay-offs, wage cuts and less predictable shift patterns as their means of staying competitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, Gemma is preparing for either redundancy or a new contract which she claims could see her pay cut by 45% and her conditions alter drastically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many workers, she is fearful that Covid-19 could provide the exact pretext needed to strip workers of their most basic rights in favour of cheaper, more flexible contracts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Gemma, fighting these reforms is the only option. \u201cIf they push through these measures I\u2019d have to leave the profession and possibly my home,\u201d she explains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u2018They\u2019re coming for the lot.\u2019<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gemma\u2019s family will be hit hard by the proposed reforms. She lives with her partner, who also works for BA and their two children in a two-bedroom flat near London and claims that the change in contracts could see them lose as much as \u00a362,000 of their income. \u201cIt\u2019s just not sustainable for raising our family,\u201d she says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a possible 12,000 employees facing redundancy and the rest preparing for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uk.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/british-airways-cabin-crew-pay-slashed-under-grim-new-contract-145651248.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a substantial loss in earning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> along with considerably <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/uk-news\/british-airways-cabin-crew-face-22036670\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more flexible terms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is clear that the crisis will have severe impacts on staff across the airline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bassa.co.uk\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (BASSA), the union which represents Gemma, claims that the changes would not only reduce pay but would see cuts to flying allowances, a move towards more flexible seasonal contracts and a decrease in layover times between flights, among other measures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the consequences of the proposals won\u2019t just be financial. Eric*, another member of the cabin crew, who is active in BASSA, fears that the crisis will lead to an overhaul of all aspects of existing contracts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey\u2019re coming for the lot,\u201d he says over the phone.\u201cWhether it be our wages, flying allowances or our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time off to recuperate.&#8221;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0He is also quick to point out that some of the measures, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TQxAUuSeCgE\">the plan to revise disciplinary procedures<\/a>, seem to have little to do with cost.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s a power move,\u201d he explains. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Eric, the proposals aim to reduce the powers of appeal that workers are entitled to during a disciplinary &#8211; meaning that it will likely be tougher for staff to hold on to their jobs. \u201cThere is no doubt that this will make it easier to get rid of us,\u201d he says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The finalised details are yet to be revealed but Eric says the current proposals look to make BA staff poorer, more precarious and more easily dispensable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This move has precedent and echoes industrial action taken by BASSA in 2010 over similar plans to \u201cimpose flexible, draconian contracts\u201d, as Eric points out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u2018Their flexibility comes at our expense.\u2019<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where previously, cabin crew were split between Eurofleet who flew within Europe and Worldwide fleet who flew across the world, the dispute resulted in the creation of \u2018Mixed fleet\u2019 contracts, for cabin crew who fly both long and short-haul &#8211; on inferior conditions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those on the Mixed fleet contract are not only paid a fraction of what those on traditional contracts make but also have different travelling allowances and shorter layover times. Currently, the more protected and better paid Eurofleet and Worldwide Fleet contracts coexist with the Mixed fleet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Eric fears that the current proposals will seek to consolidate all existing contracts into one new agreement with \u201cthe lowest standards and terms we\u2019ve ever seen, even worse than the Mixed fleet\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, for many staff, one of the most harmful changes would be increased flexibility. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think would hurt us the most,\u201d Gemma says, \u201cthat and wages\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The proposals seem stark, with <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports suggesting that remaining staff would take on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecosia.org\/search?q=british+airways+zero+hour+contracts&amp;addon=chrome&amp;addonversion=3.2.0&amp;method=topbar\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zero hours contracts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and seasonal work. \u201cIt\u2019s typical, really,\u201d Gemma adds, \u201ctheir flexibility comes at our expense\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u2018The whole thing is incredibly opportunistic.\u2019<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provided that she is fortunate enough to keep her job, Gemma speculates that her shifts will be 30% longer due to reduced layover times, which she fears will put a strain on her and her family. \u201cThey\u2019re asking us to work longer for less,\u201d she says, \u201cand this will take its toll on morale\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eric, like many of his colleagues, believes that these changes are part of BA\u2019s long-term plan to reduce costs. \u201cAll their Christmases have come at once,\u201d he says, alleging that \u201cthese suggestions have been knocking around in their desks since 1997, they just needed a chance to implement them\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, BASSA<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> claims <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it has been opposing similar reforms for decades, but that the current proposals are the most extreme of their kind. A spokesperson for the union commented:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe desire of BA to impose 12,000 redundancies and wholesale cuts to all BA contractual terms and conditions (<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which includes firing and rehiring what is left of its workforce) <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a calculated and morally bankrupt attempt to use a global health crisis to achieve what has been their aspiration for some time.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The statement refers to proposals from the airline which <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/money\/british-airways-to-axe-thousands-22081124\">would make remaining workers redundant<\/a> before choosing to rehire them on inferior conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most staff, Gemma was on furlough under the government retention scheme when she was informed of the changes and feels the crisis has been cynically appropriated by the airline. \u201cThe whole thing is incredibly opportunistic,\u201d she says. \u201cThis crisis has been an amazing chance for them to rewrite our contracts forever.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u2018BA has consistently failed to consult us.\u2019<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to some staff, the process is not just about altering conditions but crushing workers\u2019 resistance. Since the 2010 dispute, relations between BASSA and BA have been acrimonious.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the past decade, Gemma says BASSA has defended her and her colleagues from increased flexibility. However, the bitter relationship between the union and airline seems to have had a negative effect on current negotiations, with many staff complaining that BA has side-lined them from such talks. \u201cWe don\u2019t have our heads in the sand.\u201d says Eric.\u201cWe know that some tough choices will have to be made, but BA has consistently failed to consult us.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gemma agrees, pointing out that, while staff are aware that changes need to be made, BA, unlike other airlines, has attempted to push these through without any input from workers. She claims she first heard about the redundancies on the news.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sentiment is echoed by union leaders, who claim that the airline\u2019s 45-day planned consultation period over the new contracts &#8211; the statutory minimum UK law allows &#8211; is insufficient and an attempt to push through reforms without meaningful deliberation in these unprecedented times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unions argue that the period, although in line with UK employment law, should be extended to at least 90 days, due to the scale of the crisis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/mcusercontent.com\/8ddcb55d2a1a6c691c88abe7e\/files\/fc36b655-60a2-4956-a47d-d77efbcc4edf\/Alex_Cruz_BA_14.5.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a letter to BA CEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Alex Cruz, on 14 May, Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, of which BASSA <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a sizeable branch<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, accused the airline of &#8220;running down the statutory clock on consultation&#8221; by trying to negotiate whilst staff were furloughed and unions did not have proper access to their members. The letter singles out BA and claims that this tactic has made &#8220;meaningful consultations&#8221; impossible and suggests that negotiations should take place when work has resumed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BA maintains that the measures are necessary to remain in business after an unprecedented fall in demand as a result of Covid-19 and implacably denies any sidelining of unions. On 22 May, Cruz responded, claiming that Unite and the GMB had failed to attend early consultation meetings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u2018It\u2019s very easy to push around British workers.\u2019\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On 11 May, Willie Walsh, CEO of IAG, BA\u2019s parent company, told the Transport Select Committee that staff restructuring was essential, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/committees.parliament.uk\/oralevidence\/365\/pdf\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after a 50% fall in global air traffic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in March.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI deeply regret that the coronavirus crisis has had such an impact on the aviation industry and, as as a result, has led to the requirement to restructure our business,\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walsh said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this, both BA and IAG have faced backlash over the proposals, as many say that the cost of the crisis is being unfairly saddled on workers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent weeks, critics have been quick to point out that BA and IAG\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/business\/2020\/03\/16\/willie-walsh-extends-stay-british-airways-owner-iag-tackle-coronavirus\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multi-billion-pound cash reserves<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jamesasquith\/2019\/11\/04\/british-airways-owner-iag-buys-air-europa-for-1-billion\/#3f01ba0864e1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued acquisition of competitor airlines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, show that cutbacks on this scale are not necessary.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More broadly, the reforms are calling into question IAG\u2019s corporate culture, which <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/committees.parliament.uk\/oralevidence\/365\/pdf\/\">pays handsome dividends<\/a> and frequently buys back stock<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cThey\u2019ve got money for their shareholders but not for their employees,\u201d Gemma says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When approached for comment, a BA spokesperson said:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are acting now to protect as many jobs possible.

We are committed to consulting openly with our unions and our people as we prepare for a new future.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The airline&#8217;s proposals have also drawn scorn from parliament, with a Transport Select Committee report released on 13 June <a href=\"https:\/\/publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm5801\/cmselect\/cmtrans\/268\/26803.htm\">calling BA&#8217;s treatment of staff<\/a> a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;national disgrace&#8221; and a &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calculated attempt to take advantage of the pandemic&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Eric is quick to point out how much of\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the crisis can be attributed to Britain\u2019s deregulated labour market. \u201cSimply put, it\u2019s very easy to push around British workers.

      "rendered": "<p><em>As the Covid-19 pandemic escalates, capitalist states are becoming increasingly engaged in economic planning.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/sarahhansen\/2020\/04\/09\/the-fed-will-pump-another-23-trillion-into-the-economy\/#799da9332f28\">central banks pumping trillions of dollars<\/a> into their financial and corporate sectors, to states nationalising troubled corporations, the line between \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018market\u2019 \u2013 constructed by the liberal political economy \u2013 is now thinner than ever.<\/p>\n<p>Suggestions that greater levels of state intervention will automatically deliver socialism must be dismissed. Capitalist states cannot simply transform themselves into socialist ones through a few strategic nationalisations.<\/p>\n<p>At best, we may see a revival of some social democratic methods of economic management used in the post-war period. Much more likely, however, will be the emergence of a nationalist-corporatist model of economic management that combines limited state support to politically active sections of the electorate with handouts for the rich and powerful.<\/p>\n<p>Inevitably, each successive adaption to crisis generates new fissures and contradictions, of which socialists can take advantage if we are sufficiently well-organised. One such fissure can be detected in the growing politicisation of economic activity.<\/p>\n<h3>Full nationalisation.<\/h3>\n<p>Capitalist states seeking to save domestic enterprises from the consequences of the drastic slowdown in the circulation of money, people and commodities that has resulted from the \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 have lent billions of pounds to these businesses, occasionally taking equity stakes in them.<\/p>\n<p>The airline industry has been one of the worst-hit sectors by the pandemic. It&#8217;s also of strategic importance to states that wish to retain links with global markets for labour, goods, services and capital. As a result, airlines \u2013 many of which were set up by states in the post-war period before being privatised in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 are some of the first companies to be fully nationalised as a result of the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>In Germany, after entering into talks with struggling national carrier Lufthansa, the government has now stated its willingness to nationalise both Lufthansa and Condor.<\/p>\n<p>The French government, which is already a shareholder in Air France-KLM, is currently in talks with Air France about a possible full nationalisation of the company.<\/p>\n<p>Italy has already taken full control over Alitalia. And with airlines like British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific all having been forced to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jamesasquith\/2020\/04\/01\/could-airlines-be-nationalised-as-italy-takes-full-ownership-of-alitalia-will-more-airlines-follow\/#4c6225ed77df\">ground more than 90% of their fleets<\/a>, more nationalisations are likely to follow.<\/p>\n<p>In undertaking these nationalisations, states are seeking to protect jobs and domestic businesses so that capital accumulation can restart quickly when the pandemic ends and companies can be re-privatised.<\/p>\n<p>But the nationalisation process may not be as simple as policymakers currently believe.<\/p>\n<h3>Exposing the lie.<\/h3>\n<p>Companies that have received state support during the pandemic will face a PR nightmare if they engage in common profit-maximising strategies like tax avoidance, union-busting or mass layoffs.<\/p>\n<p>Many campaigners are already demanding that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2020\/apr\/01\/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">states enforce rigorous environmental standards<\/a> on nationalised airlines. These businesses may find themselves much more constrained \u2013 whether through regulation or public opinion \u2013 when the pandemic is over.<\/p>\n<p>Far more importantly, however, state action aimed at protecting domestic businesses will serve to undermine the ideology that keeps liberal capitalism functioning: the idea that there is a clear separation between \u2018the economy\u2019 and politics.<\/p>\n<p>The theory that certain issues lie in the realm of \u2018economics\u2019 and others in the realm of \u2018politics\u2019 is an ideological fiction that has been used to ease the tensions that mark the relationship between capitalism and democracy since the advent of universal suffrage.<\/p>\n<p>Liberal theorists, worried that the people would demand radical measures to curb inequality, socialise the economy and democratise state institutions, have simply argued that these topics are not appropriate for public debate and should instead be the preserve of so-called economic experts.<\/p>\n<p>By arguing that the economic is separate from the political, and by placing economic decision making in technocratic silos out of popular control, the ruling classes have largely prevented working people from making these radical economic demands.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this separation will be far harder to maintain as state intervention expands during the pandemic. People will begin to demand that the state uses its control over key businesses to expand employment, reduce inequality and promote environmental sustainability. If these demands are successful, far from retreating, pressure for much more radical measures will mount even further.<\/p>\n<h3>The potential for transformation.<\/h3>\n<p>In most capitalist economies marked by extensive state control of industry, the political system tends to be authoritarian \u2013 or at least illiberal.<\/p>\n<p>Autocracy is often necessary to maintain the fragile balance of power between labour and capital in the context of high levels of state intervention. A drift towards authoritarianism is one possible outcome of the coronavirus pandemic and is clearly underway in states like the US.<\/p>\n<p>If, however, socialists are able to organise more successfully today than they did in the wake of the financial crisis, the recovery from the pandemic could also be a time of radical political-economic transformation and working class empowerment.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, a socialist movement able to gain state power after a swathe of nationalisations had already taken place would be in a far more advantageous position than one entering government after a decade of privatisation.<\/p>\n<p>Capitalist states are already being forced to adapt in the face of one of the most significant crises to hit the global economy in centuries. Socialists must adapt faster.<\/p>\n<p><em>Grace Blakeley is an economics commentator and author of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/repeaterbooks.com\/product\/stolen-how-to-save-the-world-from-financialisation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stolen: How to Save the World from Financialisation<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n",
